<h3 id="scrum">Scrum</h3>
<p>The backend team has implemented the authentication framework and added unit testing. However, admin registration has not been added. Separate login portals should be used for recruiters and applicants.</p>
<p>The data team has successfully initialised a database with the sample data. This follows the given data model. Functions have been prepared to access and modify data on the database. Nathan will meet with Felix separately to discuss integrating this. In terms of machine learning, Justas has been thinking about comparing applicants at different stages in the application and how to specialise feedback after interview. Nathan suggests that we give feedback based on applicant specific skills, but Justas says that this isn’t helpful. Instead, he suggests that we ask recruiters to give feedback based on how well an applicant matched our assigned score. Nathan wants to have a longer discussion with the data team to outline this at the end of the meeting. Justas doesn’t think that the current feedback system gives him enough data to work with correcting for gaming the system, but Nathan and Alistair suggest that people who lie will be caught out at interview stages.</p>
<p>The frontend team hasn’t had much time to build on what they already had, however, they intend to have this complete over the weekend.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Marcus couldn’t make today’s meeting, we have rearranged to meet him next week. The documents were ‘good pieces of work’.</p>
